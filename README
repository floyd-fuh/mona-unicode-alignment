This is code of a project I did back in 2013. It was a feature I implemented for unicode buffer overflows in mona.py, where you have to fill a buffer register because you encoded your shellcode with something like the ALPHA encoders. If I think back to that time, I implemented this heuristic because corelancoder said something like "You can't do that automatically, you have to write that manually".

Back then mona.py wasn't on github. By now this is part of the mona.py of the corelan team that can be found on https://github.com/corelan/mona

This code is here for further reference and if anybody ever wants to refactor the code of me found in mona.py

Usually you do not want to use this code directly nowadays (although a non-mona.py standalone version is in this repository). You want to use https://github.com/corelan/mona
